The main factor common to the design of most collaborative interfaces for novices is that musical control is highly restricted, which makes it possible to easily learn and participate in the collective experience. Balancing this tradeoff is a key concern for designers, as this happens at the expense of providing an upward path to virtuosity with the interface. We attempt to identify design considerations exemplified by a sampling of recent collaborative devices primarily oriented toward novice interplay. It is our intention to provide a non-technical overview of design issues inherent in configuring multiplayer experiences, particularly for entrylevel players.},

We document a recent project in which two contemporary composers were commissioned to write new pieces including parts for audience participants. We analysed observational and questionnaire data from three concerts that interrogated the experiences of participants at three participatory performances in different countries (n = 273), and identified key emergent themes from participant responses: special group experience, interactive musical experience, experiencing shifting power relationships as well as an evaluative theme about the consequences of participatory elements. These categories connected substantially to concepts of active/passive, empowerment and community prevalent in discourses about participatory theatre. Quantitative analysis of participants’ ratings showed high levels of affective and cognitive engagement, moderated most by prior attendance at a preparatory workshop, and least by demographics or levels of prior musical engagement/experience.},

A distributed musical instrument is implemented entirely on a web browser for an audience to easily participate in music making with their smartphones and to generate sound on their palms. This web-based instrument is designed to encourage an audience to play music together and to interact with other audience members. Each participant composes a short musical tune that will be a musical proﬁle of oneself. Once a proﬁle is submitted, they can browse other people’s proﬁles and play a pattern they like in pairs as if one improvises with another musician. The use of musical proﬁles is a metaphor for online dating websites and the network created by the instrument mimics such social interaction where a user browses proﬁles, likes someone, and mingle with other online users.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

In this paper, we identify a gap in existing implementations of many of the popular algorithms, which is their scalability and ease of use. We describe a Natural Language Processing software framework which is based on the idea of document streaming, i.e. processing corpora document after document, in a memory independent fashion. Within this framework, we implement several popular algorithms for topical inference, including Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in a way that makes them completely independent of the training corpus size. Particular emphasis is placed on straightforward and intuitive framework design, so that modifications and extensions of the methods and/or their application by interested practitioners are effortless. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on a real-world scenario of computing document similarities within an existing digital library DML-CZ. 1.},

	abstract = {Algorithmic composition methods are applied to the generation and manipulation of beats for dance music. The goal is to create an output beat in a consistent style with continuous subtle variation rather than stale repetition. In particular two tasks are studied in depth. The first is the generation of a beat itself using algorithmic composition methods to maintain variation. Examples are given in the context of UK garage/two step. The second is an automation of breakbeat cutting, as primarily found in drum and bass, though the model and its generalisations can be applied to any music and source audio segment. A side effect of attempting to create these procedures is an enhanced modelling of the styles and therefore a contribution to analysis of the genre.},
